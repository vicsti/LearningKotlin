What may be pending wrt course:

Unit Testing with Junit 5 and Kotlin
Kotlin using coroutines

-- In Kotlin we dont need classes  to code
Use Fernflower on GitHub to decomplie kotlin  to Java code.

String templates

Kotlin  does not have switch  statement, it has when statement


Funtions dont need to be part of a class
Are introduced with "func" key words
Functions can have default parameters
Can have named parameters
Can "extend" existing types **

Kotlin supports function expressions
fun  max(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (a > b) a else b

Calling Kotlin functions from Java

-Default parameters

--Extension functions: allows us to add fuctions to classes we did not write. these functions are static functions.

-- Interfaces
